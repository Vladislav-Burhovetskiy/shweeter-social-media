# Shweeter Social Media

Shweeter is a fun clone of some twitter functionality. The main goal was to practice JS, to make more interactivity. There is no database in this project, so i used local storage for a good user experience. 
Of course, working with the server would significantly improve the performance of the application, because without a real DB you have to constantly save all changes to local storage, as well as iterate the entire array with the "database" with any interactivity. when it is 5 posts it is not terrible, but if there were a million users? But for practicing JS, it was exactly what I needed, I really liked it. After finishing the main part of this project, I spent a few more days playing around with the code and adding some additional functionality:

1. Ability to delete own tweets & comments;
2. Ability to add comments;
3. Storage and retrieval of data from local storage (comments, tweets, opening and closing comments, likes and dislikes...);
4. Divided all functions into separate modules;
5. Created my user from Battletoads;
